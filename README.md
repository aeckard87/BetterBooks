> I decompiled the jar - updated some dependencies - and found some deprecated parts in the code. Example - itemToolTip is no longer available from one of the API's used here.

> **There were no logical changes to the code! I've not taken the time yet to run through this to insure the decompiler was right. I _fully expect_ there to be bugs as is!**

> After a clean install maven build I run into a `Class not found` error for JSoup's Node class <- I've not determined what's going on here yet as I've verified the class is there in the original version that was found in there (1.8.3). I had updated to 1.10.3 and still getting the same error.
